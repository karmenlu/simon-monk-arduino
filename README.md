# Programming Arduino: Getting Started with Sketches
(2nd Edition, Simon Monk)

Arduino is a small microcontroller board with a universal serial bus (USB) to plug
into your computer and a number of connection sockets that can be wired to external electronics such as
motors, relays, light sensors, laser diodes, loud speakers, microphones, & more.

- EEPROM - electrically erasable read-only memory

## Flasher
All the folders are Arduino sketches except for the custom library: `Flasher`.
The `use_custom_library` sketch provides an example for running this library.
To use a custom library, place it at one of the following locations:
- `~/Arduino/libraries` (Ubuntu)
- `MyDocuments\Arduino` (Windows)
- `Documents/Arduino/` (macOS)
